  <h1>IDEO HCD Toolkit: Create</h1>

  <p>While I can't do the <a href="http://www.ideo.com/work/human-centered-design-toolkit/">toolkit</a> justice in my notes, I fount the Create section to be a real gem.  The goal of the Create phase is to synthesize the research of the Hear phase, identify opportunities, brainstorm solutions, and create prototypes with the purpose of eliciting feedback.  Through the create process, don't focus on feasibility and viability, instead <b>focus on desirability</b>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Story Sharing</b> - These are stories collected from in the Research phase.  When sharing, remember to be specific and be descriptive (use physical senses, cover who, what, why, when, where, and how). No judgement. Create post-it notes of key pieces of information.</li>
    <li><b>Pattern Identification</b> - Select the most surprising and provocative post-it notes, grouping them into related thoughts.  Create a succinct "insight statements" for each post-it group which summarizes the take-away.</li>
    <li><b>Find Themes</b> - Sort the insight statement cards in to themes and evaluating each to make sure they are on the same level.  Some themes may need to be generalized, while others may need to broken apart.</li>
    <li><b>Create a Visual Framework</b> - A framework is a visual representation of a system, often a framework will take one of the following structures:<br/>

      <br/>
    </li>
    <li><b>Create opportunity areas</b> - Ask the question "How might we..." (HMW) - Opportunity areas are not solutions, but questions to spur idea generation and the brainstorm of multiple solutions.</li>
    <li><b>Brainstorm!</b> - Brainstorming makes us think expansively and without constraints, so there are no bad ideas and wild ideas are encouraged.  Build on ideas using AND rather than BUT.  Go for quantity, 15-30 minutes per HMW.  The practice of generating impractical solutions often sparks ideas that are relevant and reasonable.  The toolkit provides a rough rule of thumb, that out of 100 ideas 3 may be truly useful.</li>
    <li><b>Prototype</b> - Make solutions tangible in a rapid and low-investment way. Prototypes are disposable, they should be built as roughly and as rapidly as possible.</li>
    <li><b>Feedback</b> - Feedback brings constituents directly back in to the design process.  Presenting multiple prototypes/ideas allows people to easily give honest feedback via comparing and contrasting.  For each prototype identify 3-4 questions you'd like to answer.</li>
  </ul>
