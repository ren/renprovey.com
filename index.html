<h1>1 Hour / Day</h1>

<p>In no small part inspired by <a href="http://www.davideisinger.com/">David's</a> <a href="http://techmonth.tumblr.com/">TechMonth</a>, this past week, I have been trying to put aside time for learning every day.  Not one hour of tinkering with something, but sitting down with my machine and a book and working through the examples.  Here you'll find the useful tidbits which I find filling in my knowledge gaps.</p>

<p>First up was Git (I highly recommend <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git" class="book-title">Pragmatic Version Control Using Git</a>), now for HTML5.  As usual, I'll be posting the bits and pieces here that help fill in my knowledge gaps.</p>
