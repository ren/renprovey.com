  <h1>App: Board Foot Calculator</h1>

  <p>Simply fill in the required fields of: Type (usually species of wood, eg. "Cherry"), Price (this is per foot), thickness in quarters (so a 2 inch thing board would be 8/4), length and width (you can leave these blank for 0). When you've entered all needed fields, you'll see a calculated cost and the Add to Cart button will turn blue.</p>
  <p>Tapping the Add to cart button will add the board to your cart. Swiping from right to left on any board in your cart will allow you to remove it.</p>
