  <h1>IDEO HCD Toolkit: Deliver</h1>

  <p>While reading the <a href="http://www.ideo.com/work/human-centered-design-toolkit/">HCD Toolkit</a>, I've noticed that each section is roughly the same size.  Don't get me wrong, each section has been a small wonder-world of information, but I couldn't help wonder if the Deliver section had been hardest of all to trim down.  It covers a lot of ground and not a word was wasted.  To summarize it would be to re-write it, but the pieces of the section which really resonated with me were:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Mini-Pilots &amp; Pilots</b> - These seek to allow understand and refine the solution, its context, and support system as well as possible.  I especially liked the idea of mini-pilots that focused on a subset of the solution and/or allowed participants a deeper understanding by taking them out of their traditional roles.</li>
    <li><b>On-going Learning &amp; Iteration</b> - This is something that I think is so often missed, or haphazardly bolted on at the end of a implementation.  This involves revisiting stories from the Hear phase as well as collecting new ones while continually refining the solution.

      <br/>
    </li>
    <li><b>Measuring Impact</b> - The toolkit does a great job of diving in to indicators like leading and dynamic changes (both <b>positive and negative</b>), assessing outcomes, and strategies for measuring the impact of a solution in a holistic fashion.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As you can tell, I am a big fan of the upfront work and the continual learning presented.  I think companies all too often equate a customer's final product with their final product.  A great product doesn't end with ending up in the customer's hands.  Putting a product in a customers hands is an opportunity to learn more about the product, evolve the product (see the product lines <a href='http://www.minimallyminimal.com/journal/2011/11/16/coffee-time-market-share-vs-profit.html'>here</a>), and recognize the new opportunities a strong product creates.</p>
