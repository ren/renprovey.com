  <h1>IDEO HCD Toolkit: Introduction</h1>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.ideo.com/work/human-centered-design-toolkit/">toolkit</a> was funded by the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, targeting organizations that work in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.  I am not going to lie, while traveling to Asia would be wonderful, I am reading the toolkit hoping to draw out some more general lessons of the human centered design process.</p>

  <h2>The Three Lenses of Human Centered Design</h2>
  <p>The HCD process examines starts with the people being designed for, examining thier needs, dreams, and behaviors.  The process steps through the following 'lenses':</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Desirability</b> - What do people desire?<br/>
      eg. Rocket pants, space cars, unicorns, and sporks.  To be desired something dosen't necessarily have to be feasible, which brings us to...</li>
    <li><b>Feasibility</b> - What is technically and organizationally feasible?<br/>
      And now we have to cross rocket pants, space cars, and unicorns off the list, leaving us to examinine the viability of sporks.</li>
    <li><b>Viability</b> - What can be financially viable?<br/>
      So, I am assuming the spork business is pretty competative and covered by many interenational patents and we're back to the drawing board.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>In summation:</p>
