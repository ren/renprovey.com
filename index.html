<h1>1 Hour / Day</h1>
<p>In no small part inspired by <a href="http://www.davideisinger.com/">David's</a> <a href="http://techmonth.tumblr.com/">TechMonth</a>, this past week, I have been trying to put aside time for learning every day.  Not one hour of tinkering with something, but sitting down with my machine and a book and working through the examples.  Here you'll find the useful tidbits which I find filling in my knowledge gaps.</p>

<p>The other day, I got to see <a href="http://jasonrudolph.com/">Jason</a> rock some major git-fu (at least to me), so for my first book I choose <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git" class="title">Pragmatic Version Control Using Git</a>.  The embarrassing thing for me is that I've had this book for 8 months, but have mainly been using it as a reference, a quick lookup here, a quick check there.  So as I read a bit each day, I'll be posting the bits and pieces here that help fill in my knowledge gaps.</p>
