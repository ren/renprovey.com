  <h1>Hello HTML5</h1>

  <p>To get ready for writing today's post, I polished up this blog's <a href="http://github.com/ren/renprovey.com">source code</a>.  If you're like me, you're probably looking to jump into code as soon as possible.  To that end, head over to Paul Irish's excellent <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, download the commented template and start reading through while building.</p>
  
  <h2>Resources I'll Be Using</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://books.alistapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers">HTML5 For Web Designers</a> - it is small and fast, gets the job done for your markup.</li>
    <li><a href="http://html5doctor.com/">HTML5 Doctor</a> - a great reference, exampled, and explained.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>I'll try to keep this list updated as I find other useful resources.  For now have fun with <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>.
