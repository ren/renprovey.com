  <h1>New Haven Ho!</h1>

  <p>The cat is officially out of the bag.  After a healthy amount of collective anguishing, Candice has accepted the position of Associate Chaplain at Yale University.  We're dreading leaving Durham, excited to explore New Haven, and thrilled that Yale and Duke share similar color schemes.</p>

	<p>To this end, if you know of great places to live in New Haven, interesting places to work, or people who enjoy eating pizza as much as I do â€“ please let <a href="mailto:ren@renprovey.com">me</a> know.
