  <h1>IDEO HCD Toolkit: Hear</h1>

  <p>As the <a href="http://www.ideo.com/work/human-centered-design-toolkit/">toolkit</a> is meant to, the Hear section is very focused on working with folks in under resourced areas of the world, but I found a few principles which are easily extended to a process working with a broader group.  The goal of the Hear phase is to gain a strong understanding of an audience's needs, barriers, and constraints.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Engage in context</b> - While this section is called <i>Hear</i>, context is the reoccuring theme.  The way a person presents a narrative, can differ from actual observation, especially when a person is learning a new skill or process. So, hear with all five senses, and hear in the actual environment a person will be operating in.</li>
    <li><b>Be qualitative</b> - Seek a broad understanding.  Work to understand a person's social, political, economic, and cultural oppertunities as well as barriers.  Analyze the relational dynamics in a system (eg., people, places, objects, and institiutions).</li>
    <li><b>Testing</b> - This is the chance to validate assumptions and preconceptions, be very intentional about letting any through without verfiying them.</li>
    <li><b>Framing</b> - Challenges and statements should all be framed from constituents point of view.</li>
    <li><b>Inspiration</b> - Look for inspiration in new places, search for similar problems in different contexts.  The concept seems so incredibly straight forward, but rarely to I take the time to intentionally think about parallels of a design problem.  The toolkit gives the example of hospital staff visiting a hardware store to gain insight about organizing supplies.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The toolkit goes in to excellent detail on how to identifying a challenge, recognizing existing knowledge, research, interview, immerse, and document.</p>
