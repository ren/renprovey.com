  <h1>HBR: Murray's Law for Success on Your Terms</h1>

   <blockquote cite="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/07/murrays_law_for_success_on_you.html">
    <p>There are three critical ideas within Murray's two sentences:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Are you positioning yourself so that one day, you do not have to work?</li>
      <li>When you no longer have a financial need to work in the role you occupy, would you still continue to occupy that role?</li>
      <li>Do you define your own standards of career excellence?</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote cite="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/07/murrays_law_for_success_on_you.html">
    <p>There are three phases in a professional life:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning the "Game."</li>
      <li>Winning the "Game."</li>
      <li>Defining the "Game."</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Where are you? Where do you want to be?</p>

  <p>I'll keep the cheap and preachy to a minimum the next few weeks, but wanted to record this.</p>
